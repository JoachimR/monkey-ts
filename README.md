# Writing an interpreter in TypeScript

This is a TypeScript implementation of the Monkey programming language, as described in the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball. Monkey is a simple interpreted language with a C-like syntax and was designed for learning purposes.

[Inspired by RonaldDijks TS implementation](https://github.com/RonaldDijks/writing-an-interpreter-in-typescript)

However this implementation also includes the last chapters of the book (arrays, objects, builtin functions and their usages).
